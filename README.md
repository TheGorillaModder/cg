Once you visit our website at https://thegorillamodder.github.io/cg, you'll notice it looks like a regular calculatorâ€”maybe even a bit too simple. But thatâ€™s actually the point!
Yes, the calculator works perfectly fine. But if you look closely, especially at the top-left corner, youâ€™ll see a button labeled "More Help". Spoiler alert: it doesnâ€™t give you more help. Instead, it takes you straight to our hidden HTML5 games collection!
Weâ€™ve gathered a bunch of fun, popular browser games and packed them all into one simple site disguised as a calculator. ðŸŽ®
We're still working hard to improve and expand our collectionâ€”and weâ€™d love your input!

Why we made this you may ask?
We made this for the pure entertainment of users when bored. Lets say little timmy gets bored during class but doesn't want to be suspicous about being on a game. Behold Calculator Games so we can provide help to all users that don't want to get caught playing games during class or work.
We made our website in a way so the "PANIC!" button when in our HTML5 game collection will bring you back to our calculator and it will look like nothing happened and you were just trying to solve a math equation.
Now you may be thinking, "But what about all my progress? Is it just going to disappear? Is it all going to be gone?" Well actually no it isn't and this may sound weird for anyone who does't know anything about HTML5 but we simply hide the game window.
The calculator window is then turned on and placed over the game window while the game window is hidden. So then all your progress is still saved in th background, but the game does continue playing while it's hidden... So try to pause the game first!
